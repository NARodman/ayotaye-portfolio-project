# ayotaye-portfolio-project
 This is a portfolio project I create for my friend who makes music beats.

 --Documentation--

 Day 1: I uploaded the file skeletons with no code and committed the changes. 

 Day 2: Didn't have much time today, so I added the html skeleton code.

 Day 3: I started the menu section and added the google font that I wanted to use, which I'll paste here. I still need to add colors, but I'm trying to decide which ones. 
 Google font: @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Dosis:wght@200..800&display=swap');

 Day 4-: Continuing on the stylesheet, I picked out the text and background colors. For right now I chose a mix of purples as the main focus of color. This will probably changed later. The font family I chose was Dosis. 

 Day 5: Finishing up the header section. Starting the home section. 

 Day 6: Fixed the image upload, so that it had a transparent background. Started working on the JS for the occupation animation and added styles in the CSS for the home section.
